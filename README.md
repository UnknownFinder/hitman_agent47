# hitman_agent47
It's a small project of a small man to help users create some important and useful settings as creating iptables chains and system daemon to avoid hardware crushs and overloads for your Linux machines.
Now I will explain how to use it:
Read text on your screen and follow it, but remember, that if you have entered some incorrect or not-from-list parameters, system will finish the script.
Hitman will work with iptables and some system files, so run it ONLY WITH SUDO!
