# hitman_agent47
It's a small project of a small man to help users create some important and useful settings as creating iptables chains and system daemon to avoid hardware crushs and overloads for your Linux machines.
Now I will explain how to use it:
Read text on your screen and follow it, but remember, that if you have entered some incorrect or not-from-list parameters, system will finish the script.
Hitman will work with iptables and some system files, so run it ONLY WITH SUDO!
You can install my project by using $ git clone https://github.com/UnknownFinder/hitman_agent47
When it will be installed, use $cd hitman_agent47
Then get enough rights for every script, like $chmod +x [script name]. 
Then start the "agent-47.sh" script as a sudo user.
To run script use $sudo sh agent-47.sh, but before check, that you have already installed iptables!
